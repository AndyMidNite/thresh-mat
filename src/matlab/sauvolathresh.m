function output = sauvolathresh(img, win_size, k_value, r_value)
%SAUVOLATHRESH Compute an image threshold value using Sauvola/Pietaksinen algorithm.
%  SAUVOLATHRESH returns a binarized image using the Sauvola/Pietaksinen's document binarization algorithm.
%  
%  Synopsis:
%      output = sauvolathresh(img)
%      output = sauvolathresh(img, win_size)	 
%      output = sauvolathresh(img, win_size, k_value)
%      output = sauvolathresh(img, win_size, k_value, r_value)
%
%  Input:
%      img = input image to be segmented (required)
%      win_size = window size around each pixel (required)
%      k_value = constant ranging between 0.2 and 0.5 (default)
%      r_value = estimated maximum value of the standard deviation (128 works well for grayscale documents)
%  
%  Output:
%      output = binarized image according to the threshold value computed by the algorithm.
