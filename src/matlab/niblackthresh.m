function output = niblackthresh(img, win_size, k_value)
%NIBLACKTHRESH Compute an image threshold value using Niblack's
% algorithm. NIBLACKTHRESH returns a binarized image using the
% Niblack's binarization algorithm.
%
%  Synopsis: 
%            output = niblackthresh(img) 
%            output = niblackthresh(img, win_size) 
%            output = niblackthresh(img, win_size, k_value)
%
%  Input: 
%         img = input image to be segmented (required) 
%         win_size = window size around each pixel (required) 
%         k_value = constant ranging between 0.2 for bright objects 
%                   (default) and -0.2 for dark objects
%
%  Output: 
%         output = binarized image according to the threshold value
%                  computed by the algorithm.
