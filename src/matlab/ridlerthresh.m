function threshold = ridlerthresh(img, tolerance)
%RIDLERTHRESH Compute an image threshold value using Ridler/Calvard's algorithm.
%  RIDLERTHRESH returns an integer between 0 and 1 that represents a normalized image threshold value 
%  that segments the input image, according to Ridler/Calvard's algorithm.
%  
%  Synopsis:
%      threshold = ridlerthresh(img)
%      threshold = ridlerthresh(img, tolerance)
%
%  Input:
%      img       = input image to be segmented (required)
%      tolerance = amount of difference between a current and previous threshold value
%                  until convergence is determined. Default = 0.5
%  
%  Output:
%      threshold = value between 0 and 1 representing the threshold.
