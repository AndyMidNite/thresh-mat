Image Thresholding for MATLAB
=============================

This project is an implementation of common image thresholding algorithms in MATLAB.

Image thresholding algorithms segment an input image into two regions: object (those pixels whose gray-level value is greater than a given threshold) and background. A black and white image is output by coloring each pixel black or white, depending on the label assigned by the algorithm.

This project is targeted at researchers in the image processing and computer vision fields.
